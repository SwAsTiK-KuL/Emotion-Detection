When implementing a machine learning model through code, it's crucial to tailor the training and testing datasets to your specific requirements. The code typically involves loading data from files, and for your customized application, you should replace the existing data files with your own dataset. This replacement ensures that the model learns from relevant and representative examples, aligning with the specific characteristics of your problem.

Furthermore, adjusting the number of epochs is a key aspect of training a model. Epochs represent the number of times the model iterates over the entire training dataset during the learning process. It's important to strike a balance to prevent overfitting or underfitting. Experimentation with different epoch values is necessary, as it allows you to find the optimal number that maximizes the model's accuracy without overtraining on the training set or failing to generalize to new data.
